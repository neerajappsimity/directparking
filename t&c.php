<p>
Direct Parking is a Platform powered by open-source software that provides a marketplace for Riders (Riders
or you) who seeks transportation to certain destinations (a parking spot) by matching with drivers (Drivers or
you) who are driving to or searching for certain destinations (a parking spot). The Drivers and Riders are both
users of the Services provided by Direct Parking and are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Users."
Direct Parking is solely a platform for Drivers and Riders to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate
the provision of Transportation Services. Direct Parking does not provide or contract for Transportation
Services, and Drivers and Riders contract independently for the provision of Transportation Services. Each
Rider is solely responsible for selecting the Driver, and the location at which to be picked up at, whether on the
premises set by the Driver or at a location designated by the Rider. Any decision by a Rider to receive
Transportation Services or by a Driver to provide Transportation Services to the Rider is a decision made in
such person's sole discretion.</p>
<p>
Direct Engineering Technologies does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing,
durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Transportation Services provided
by Drivers nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Drivers or
Riders. Direct Engineering Technologies makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to
Transportation Services offered or provided by Drivers or requested by Riders through use of the Services,

Direct Parking Platform.</p>
<p>
Although the Services are intended to provide each User’s availability in real-time, it is possible that a

or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to the

jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's

<h3>
Rules and Governing Law</h3>
<p>

have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or
formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement
is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues,
including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration,
including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this
Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant
thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest
extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this
Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state
of Texas.</p>
<h3>
Process</h3>
<p>
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration
as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration
Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired
judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of Texas and will be selected by the
parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an
Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the
Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<h3>
Location and Procedure.</h3>
<p>
Unless you and Direct Engineering Technologies otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the
county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely
on the basis of documents you and Direct Engineering Technologies submit to the Arbitrator, unless you
request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your
right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have
the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited
nature of the arbitration.</p>
<h3>
Arbitrator's Decision</h3>
<p>
The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the
arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may
award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide
relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. An Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all
parties. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent
provided under applicable law. Direct Engineering Technologies will not seek, and hereby waives all rights
Direct Engineering Technologies may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if
Direct Engineering Technologies prevails in arbitration.</p>
<h3>
Fees</h3>
<p>
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the
AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Direct Engineering Technologies
will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in
your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>

Severability and Survival</h3>
<p>
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the
unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or
unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the
parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration
Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or
representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any
individual claims in arbitration.</p>
